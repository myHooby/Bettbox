<p align="center">
  <strong>Another Better Mihomo Client, Forked from FlClash</strong>
</p>

**Bettbox is a cross-platform traffic routing and DNS debugging tool, deeply built on the powerful Mihomo core. We focus on privacy, security, and refined feature details, dedicated to delivering a better client experience (The project has already taken the lead in passing manual security provenance review by the SignPath Foundation, and the Windows client is signed with an OV digital certificate).**

Guided by the principle of "Better Experience", Bettbox inherits the original sleek UI while deeply optimizing numerous details along with practical features and logic across platforms. Core characteristics and goals: smooth foreground, power-saving background — dedicated to becoming a better Mihomo client that runs stably over the long term with minimal resource consumption.

Bettbox stands for: Better Experience, Out of the box.

## 💻 Build & UI Customization

Building on Windows:

* Requires a Windows PC (OS ≥ Windows 10)
* Dependencies: Git, Visual Studio, Flutter 3.44.x, Golang, Inno Setup, Rust
```bash
* flutter pub get
* dart .\setup.dart windows --arch amd64 --out core (Build Core only)
* dart .\setup.dart windows --arch amd64 --out app --compatible (Optional Compatible build)
* Output binaries are located in the `dist/` directory
```

Custom Script UI Adaptation:

* Starting from v1.18.8, Bettbox supports external override scripts for UI adaptation. Taking AIsouler's **[Script/Config Repository](https://github.com/AIsouler/MyClash)** as an example, simply add the following declaration on the first line of your script to enable Bettbox built-in visual toggles:
* <code>const Compatible_With_Bettbox = { ruleOptionsEnable: true };</code>
* If a script mixes policy group switches with other feature switches, declare which ones belong to policy groups via `policyGroupOptions`. Undeclared switches are collected into an "⚙️ Other Settings" second-level page at the end of the list, while policy group switches keep the original list layout:

```js
const Compatible_With_Bettbox = {
  ruleOptionsEnable: true,
  // Names of the switches that belong to policy groups; must match the keys of ruleOptionsEnable exactly
  policyGroupOptions: ['🚀 Node Select', '🛑 Ad Block'],
};
```

* Without `policyGroupOptions`, or when the declared names match no switch, the layout stays exactly the same as before (all switches in a single list).
